## About the project

The system predicts diseases based on your existing symptoms and allows you to select from available doctors for an online diagnosis process. This includes an online diagnosis via video meetings, for which the user is required to pay. Additionally, the system helps you locate nearby hospitals, complete with ratings and information about fees per day.
